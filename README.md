# Features
Real-time facial emotion recognition from a webcam feed
Detection of six basic emotions: happy, sad, angry, surprised, disgusted, and neutral
Model trained on the FER-2013 dataset
Graphical user interface (GUI) for easy use

# Requirements
Python 3.6 or higher
Keras 2.2.4 or higher
OpenCV 4.0 or higher
NumPy 1.16.4 or higher
Matplotlib 3.1.0 or higher

# Usage
Open the program by running the main.py file.

Click on the "Start" button to begin the facial emotion recognition process.

Hold your face in front of the webcam and wait for the program to detect your face.

The program will display the detected emotion on the screen.
